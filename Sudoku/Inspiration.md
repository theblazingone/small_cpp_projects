I have always been obsessed with sudokus.
Since as a child I have solved many sudokus in the newspaper. It was my hobby to crack the sudokus is minimum time.
Now, I have got computational power to back me up with this.
With this I started making sudoku solver using cpp.
And here I am showcasing my new small cpp project.

This project uses backtracking to solve sudoku.
